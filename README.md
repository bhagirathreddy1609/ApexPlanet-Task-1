# ApexPlanet-Task-1

ðŸš€ Day 1 of my Web Development Journey!

Today, I worked on the basics of Web Development by building my first simple webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

âœ¨ What I learned:

HTML for structuring the webpage (headings, paragraphs, images, links).

CSS for styling (colors, fonts, spacing, layout).

JavaScript for interactivity (a button that shows an alert when clicked).

ðŸ’» Excited to keep building and learning more over the next few days!

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to explore exciting web development concepts and projects!
